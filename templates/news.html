            <h2>AI Pedagogy Platform Launches at WPI</h2>
            <p>
                We're excited to announce the launch of the AI Pedagogy platform at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
                This new resource hub will serve as a central location for faculty and students to access materials, 
                share experiences, and learn about best practices for integrating AI into education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform features curated resources, case studies from WPI courses, and regular updates about 
                AI education initiatives on campus. We invite all members of the WPI community to explore the 
                resources and join us in shaping the future of AI-enhanced learning.
