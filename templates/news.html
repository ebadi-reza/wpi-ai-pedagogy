            <h2>AI Pedagogy Platform Launches at WPI</h2>
            <p>
                We're excited to announce the launch of the AI Pedagogy platform at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
                This new resource hub will serve as a central location for faculty and students to access materials, 
                share experiences, and learn about best practices for integrating AI into education.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform features curated resources, case studies from WPI courses, and regular updates about 
                AI education initiatives on campus. We invite all members of the WPI community to explore the 
                resources and join us in shaping the future of AI-enhanced learning.

			<h2>WPI Faculty AI Baseline Survey Results Released</h2>
			<p>
				Thank you to the 155 faculty who participated in the AI Baseline Survey this fall. 
				The results show that nearly half of respondents use AI tools regularly or frequently, 
				while the majority identify as beginners or intermediates in skill level. 
				Faculty expressed the greatest need for support around <strong>ethics and academic integrity</strong>, 
				<strong>classroom activities</strong>, and <strong>assignment redesign</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				These insights will guide upcoming programming, including our first AI Pedagogy Lab on 
				<em>Ethics and Academic Integrity</em> on October 9. 
				Together, we are building a thoughtful, ethical, and practical approach to AI at WPI.
